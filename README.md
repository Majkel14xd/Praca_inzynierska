# Design, construction and software of a rainfall recording device on the Arduino platform.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a system for measuring water levels after rainfall, providing online data collection and presentation, and allowing device monitoring through a mobile application. The author plans to conduct a review of existing solutions and showcase selected technologies, such as the Arduino IDE software, Python programming language with the Django framework, and the MySQL database system. The rainfall recording device project will involve the development of program code, integration of the ESP32 module with water level, YL-83 rainfall sensor, and ultrasonic distance sensor HC-SR04. The system will be configured using the Blynk platform, and an appropriate database will be prepared. Functional tests of the system will be conducted as part of the project.
